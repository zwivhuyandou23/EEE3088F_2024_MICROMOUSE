# Welcome to the EEE3088F_2024_MICROMOUSE hardware project

## Name
 2024 Micromouse Project

## Description
The Micromouse Project is a maze-solving robot project designed for the EEE3088F 2024 course. Students will focus on designing and manufacturing sensor and power modules for the micro-mouse, meeting specific project requirements while adhering to a strict budget.

## Features
- Sensor module for detecting obstacles
- Power module for powering the entire system
- Integration with provided motherboard and processor boards
- Demonstration of obstacle detection capabilities
## Project Scenarios
Maze completion.

## Usage
The Micromouse project is intended for educational purposes in the EEE3088F 2024 course. Zwivhuya Ndou, Innocent Makhubela worked on designing, manufacturing, and demonstrating the sensor and power modules for the micro-mouse robot. To access and contribute to the Micromouse project, you will need KiCad to open the project PCB and schematic designs, as well as an IDE that supports C programming for coding the sensor integration.

## Installation
To access some of the contents on the repo you will need kicad to open the project PCB, Schematics designs and an IDE that supports C programming
